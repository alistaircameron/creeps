% Package users acknowledge the following: I understand that this package provides a probabilistic match between names found in my .bib file and publicly available lists of individuals accused of, or convicted of sexual harassment and/or other academic misconduct. It is my responsibility to verify the information provided in these databases, to ensure that the match is accurate, and I am entirely responsible for any action I take as a result of learning of the match. I acknowledge that the package authors guarantee neither the accuracy of the lists, nor the accuracy of the match between .bib files and the list. I am aware that the original data source can be found here: https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/
